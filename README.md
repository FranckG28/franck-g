# franck-g.fr

The code source of my personal website, showcasing my projects, experiences, photos and videos.


[Visit â†’][franck-g]

It's still under development. I'm currently working on some features and improvements.

## Tech stack

This website was built on top of the ["Next.js Blog with a Native Authoring Experience"][template-source] template.

It offers a statically generated pages that uses [Next.js][nextjs] for the frontend and [Sanity][sanity-homepage] to handle its content.

It comes with a native Sanity Studio that offers features like real-time collaboration, instant side-by-side content previews, and intuitive editing.

> **Note**
>
> This project still uses the `/pages` directory for Next.js routing.
> I might migrate it to the [/app][app-dir] directory in the future.
>
> Live preview during editing doesn't work for the moment. I focused on having a functional website first.

## Getting started

**All the informations about the template, its features, and how to use it are available in the [template repository][template-source].**

You need to create a have a [sanity.io][sanity-homepage] project. Follow the [.env.local.example][`.env.local.example`] file to create a `.env.local` file with your project data.

Don't forget to install the dependencies on the first run

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then you can start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000][localhost-3000] with your browser to see the result.

Open [http://localhost:3000/studio][localhost-3000-studio] to access the Sanity Studio.
